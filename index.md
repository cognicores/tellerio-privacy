# Privacy Policy for Tellerio

**Last Updated: February 2026**

Tellerio (“the App”) is developed and operated by CogniCores (“we”, “us”, or “our”).

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Tellerio mobile application.

Tellerio is designed for children and families and complies with:

- The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) – United States  
- The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – European Union  
- The UK GDPR – United Kingdom  

---

## 1. Intended Audience

Tellerio is intended for children under 13 years of age, with parental involvement. We are committed to minimizing data collection and protecting children's privacy.

No account registration is required to use the App.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Data

We do **not** collect, store, or request personal data such as:

- Names  
- Email addresses  
- Phone numbers  
- Home addresses  
- Precise location data  
- Advertising identifiers  
- Contacts, photos, or device files  

Users can access all core features without providing personal information.

---

### 2.2 Story Prompts and AI Processing

When a user generates a story:

- The text entered in the App (the “prompt”) is securely transmitted to our backend server.
- Our backend runs the Llama 3.2 3B AI model in a cloud environment.
- The prompt is processed solely to generate the requested story.
- The generated story is returned to the device.

We do **not**:

- Store prompts permanently  
- Use prompts to train AI models  
- Sell or share prompts  
- Use prompts for advertising or profiling  

Prompts are processed transiently and only for providing the requested functionality.

---

### 2.3 Local Device Storage

Stories saved by the user and app preferences are stored locally on the device.

We do not remotely access or copy local content.

Deleting the App removes locally stored data.

---

### 2.4 Purchases and Subscriptions

If users purchase subscriptions or in-app content:

- Payments are processed securely by Google Play.
- We may use services such as RevenueCat to manage subscription status.
- We do not receive or store credit card or payment details.

---

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing (EU & UK Users)

For users located in the European Union and United Kingdom, our legal basis for limited data processing (such as transmitting prompts to generate stories) is:

- **Performance of a contract** – Processing is necessary to provide the story generation service requested by the user.
- **Legitimate interests** – Ensuring the security, reliability, and proper functioning of the App.

Because Tellerio does not collect identifiable personal data, most usage does not involve personal data processing.

---

## 4. International Data Transfers

Our backend infrastructure may process data on servers located outside your country of residence.

Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards consistent with:

- GDPR (Chapter V)  
- UK GDPR international transfer requirements  

All data transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- Prompts are processed only for generating AI responses.
- We do not retain prompts beyond what is technically necessary to deliver the response.
- We do not maintain user profiles or long-term behavioral records.
- Local content remains on the user’s device unless deleted.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

Because Tellerio does not collect personal identifiers, parental consent mechanisms are not required under COPPA.

If you believe that personal information has been provided unintentionally, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

---

## 7. User Rights (EU & UK)

If you are located in the EU or UK, you have the right to:

- Request access to personal data  
- Request correction or deletion  
- Restrict or object to processing  
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority  

However, since we do not store identifiable personal data, we may not be able to associate data with a specific individual.

---

## 8. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including:

- Encrypted transmission (HTTPS/TLS)  
- Secure backend infrastructure  
- Restricted access to systems  

While no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, we take appropriate steps to protect data.

---

## 9. Third-Party Services

We may rely on trusted third-party services for:

- Cloud infrastructure hosting  
- Subscription management  
- App distribution (Google Play)

These providers process only the data necessary to provide their services and operate under their own privacy policies.

---

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted at this page with a revised “Last Updated” date.
